Question 5: What is type inference in TypeScript? Why is it helpful? <br />
Answer: Type inference in TypeScript is basically the compiler's ability to figure out the data type of something – like a variable – even when I haven't explicitly told it what that type is. It's like TypeScript playing detective with my code. Instead of me saying, 'Hey, this variable message is definitely a string,' if I just write let message = "Hello!", TypeScript is smart enough to go, '"Hello!" looks like a string, so message must be a string!' It does this for numbers, booleans, and even more complex things like objects and arrays.

Firstly, I find type inference super helpful for a few reasons. First off, it makes my code way less cluttered. I don't have to write out all those type annotations all the time, which can get pretty repetitive. This makes my code cleaner and, I think, easier to read at a glance.
Secondly, it speeds things up when I'm coding. I can just declare a variable and assign a value, and TypeScript usually gets it right. This means I can focus more on the actual logic of what I'm trying to build instead of getting bogged down in typing everything out.
Plus, even though I'm not explicitly writing the types, I still get the benefits of TypeScript's type checking. So, if I accidentally try to do something that doesn't make sense with the inferred type – like trying to multiply my message string by 5 – TypeScript will still catch that error. It's like having the safety net of static typing without having to be super verbose all the time.

So, in short, type inference makes writing TypeScript feel a bit more like writing JavaScript in some ways – less typing! – but I still get the strong typing benefits under the hood. It helps me write cleaner, faster, and still relatively safe code.

Question 6: How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?<br />
Answer: The biggest way TypeScript boosts code quality is through its static typing. By letting me (and often encouraging me) to explicitly define the types of my variables and function inputs/outputs, TypeScript acts like a really helpful early warning system. It catches a whole bunch of potential errors – like trying to use a number as if it were a string – before I even run my code. This means fewer runtime bugs and a more stable application overall, which definitely ups the code quality.
Then there's the aspect of understandability. When I look at a piece of TypeScript code and I can clearly see the expected types, it's just easier to grasp what's going on. Function signatures become much clearer about what they take in and what they spit out. This makes the code more readable, not just for me when I come back to it later, but also for anyone else who might be working on the project. And when code is easier to understand, it's generally higher quality because there's less room for misinterpretations.
Now, when it comes to project maintainability, I think TypeScript is a game-changer. Because the code is more explicit about types and potential errors are caught early, it becomes much less daunting to go back and make changes or add new features. I feel more confident that my tweaks won't accidentally break something else because TypeScript will often flag any type mismatches I introduce.
Think about trying to refactor a large JavaScript codebase versus a TypeScript one. In TypeScript, if I change the structure of an object or the signature of a function, the compiler will point out all the places in the code that are now out of sync. This makes refactoring much safer and less likely to introduce new, hidden bugs.
Plus, the strong typing in TypeScript often leads to better tooling. My IDE can provide much more accurate autocompletion and navigation because it understands the types I'm working with. This makes the development process smoother and more efficient in the long run, which definitely contributes to maintainability.
So, in short, TypeScript helps improve code quality by catching errors early and making the code clearer. This, in turn, makes the project much easier to maintain because it's safer to modify, refactor, and extend the codebase without fear of things breaking unexpectedly. It's like having a safety net and a well-documented map for the project.
